Group project for COMP-5361

Welcome to our GitHub repository. You can commit changes here online, with the GitHub desktop application, through the EGit plugin for Eclipse, or through the command line. Everybody should probably commit to your own branch of the repository, and we can figure out a process for merging into the master branch.

It's probably a good idea to develop a protocol for commits before we start committing!
